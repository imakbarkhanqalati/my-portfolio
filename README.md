Interactive 3D Portfolio Website
Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is a showcase of my skills in front-end development, with a focus on creating modern, animated, and interactive user experiences.

About The Project
This isn't just a standard portfolio; it's a fully immersive digital environment designed to reflect a passion for futuristic aesthetics and cutting-edge web technologies. The goal was to move beyond static pages and create a memorable experience for visitors.

Key Features
Liquid Glass UI: A sleek, modern design using "glass morphism" panels with blur, transparency, and subtle glows.

3D Hero Section: An animated and interactive 3D hero background created with Three.js.

Dynamic Animations: Engaging scroll-based "kinetic typography" and hover effects on interactive elements.

Responsive Design: A fully responsive layout that ensures a great experience on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

Voice Navigation (Optional): Includes an experimental voice command feature for hands-free navigation.

Tech Stack
This project was built from the ground up using core web technologies:

HTML5

CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS for utility classes)

JavaScript (ES6+)

Three.js for the 3D graphics

No front-end frameworks were used in the final version, making it a lightweight and custom-built experience.

How to View
Simply visit the live site to experience the portfolio. No installation is required. The entire project is self-contained in the index.html file in this repository.
